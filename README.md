# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

I had originally made this because my screen was turning black last night and I couldn't find out why! Turns out I had to forgot to run npm run build.
Now I see the html and css running after running npm run dev. Finally! I was freaking out. Hopefully the other project works, else I'll just paste over the original fetch and html.

It's like I'm spending more time making Vite work than actually coding and eerything that can go wrong suddenly is. I even made this to get away from the rampant isues I was having with the previous build. This is so frustrating. 

    "tent Security Policy of your site blocks the use of 'eval' in JavaScript`
    The Content Security Policy (CSP) prevents the evaluation of arbitrary strings as JavaScript to make it more difficult for an attacker to inject unathorized code on your site.
    To solve this issue, avoid using eval(), new Function(), setTimeout([string], ...) and setInterval([string], ...) for evaluating strings.
    If you absolutely must: you can enable string evaluation by adding unsafe-eval as an allowed source in a script-src directive.
    ⚠️ Allowing string evaluation comes at the risk of inline script injection.
